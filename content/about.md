## How to prepare samples for FESEM/EDS analysis ?

Because FESEM utilizes vacuum conditions and uses electron beam to form an image, special  sample preparations is needed as listed below:
  
	• The sample is mounted on carbon tape that is put on the surface of the stub. 
	• Approximate size of the sample 1 x 1 cm (max). 
	• All water must be removed from the samples because the water would vaporize in the vacuum. 
	• Electrically conductive samples do not require any preparation before being used, however the  samples must be completely dry and free from volatile substances. 
	• Non-conductive samples need to be made conductive by coating the sample (using sputter coater)  with a thin layer of conductive material like Au/Ag/C.
